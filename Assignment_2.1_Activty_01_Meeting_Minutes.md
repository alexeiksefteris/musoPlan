# MusoPlan Meeting Minutes Summary

**Date**: 16/11/2023  
**Time**: 11:30 to 11:45  
**Who Was There**: Iresha and Alexei  
**Platform**: Microsoft Teams

## What was discussed:

### 1. About the Musicians and Groups
- We chatted about what info we need for each musician (name, how long they’ve been playing, genre of music) and for the music groups (group name, how many people are in it, and how long they play for.)

### 2. Sorting Musicians and Groups
- We looked at how to organize different types of musicians (like guitar players or bassists) and how these musicians fit into music groups.

### 3. How the software will work
- We spoke about what the software needs to do regularly like adding musicians to groups, and any specific rules we need to follow (like how many people can be in a group).

### 4. Putting Information in
- We discussed how to put data into the software, mainly using command-line inputs, and what the rules are for the data.

### 5. Getting information out
- We covered how the software will show or save the information about the groups and musicians. We want it to be easy to read, like showing one item per line.

## Main things the software will do:
1. Create musician.
2. Create troupe.
3. Add a musician to troupe (displaying a list of troupe names).
4. Calculate cost of deployment.
5. Export names to a text file.
6. Import names of troupe.
7. Provide summary information.
8. Provide detailed description.
9. Exit the program.

Basically, we will register musicians, put them into a category, create music groups add musicians to the music group, show a brief detailed info about said group. Import and export the group names, figure out how much everything will cost. Additional request of an `exit` button.

## Extra Notes:
- We’ll only use musicians that are already registered in our system when we’re making new groups.
- When we save info to text files, it should be easy to read, with each thing on its own line.

## Wrapping Up:
- We summed up everything we talked about and agreed on what we need to do next.
- Our next meeting, we will be brief update on how things are going.

**End of meeting time**: 11:45 AM
