# VCS Use Report
## Introduction

Throughout the development of MusoPlan the Version Control System(VCS) played a crucial role.
Git (the VCS I used), was integral in manging all my code changes, ensuring for a smooth collaboration,
and maintaining a history of all my modifications. This report will outline the challenges I faced,
how I followed organizational rules, and how I checked that the VCS was working correctly.

## Encountered Challenges

### Managing Multiple Branches
Juggling between several branches and making sure I was in the correct one was a bit troublesome at the beginning.
But once you start getting used to the structure and how it works, such as adding before commiting. You get used to it,
performing the commands so often trained them into my memory and before too long it became second nature.

### Resolving merge conflicts
I had an issue early one where I was getting too many errors with my project. I ended up coming to the decision that it would
just be better off to start again. The time spent trying to fix all the errors would of just taken up more time then starting a new
project. So I did just that, however I didn't create a new github, and ended up having some merge conflicts when I was trying to add the 
new project files to the repository. The issue ended up being solved however after just creating a new github and adding that one as a collaborator
to the previous one.

## Compliance with Organizational Requirements

Throughout the develpoment process, I ensured that MusoPlan complied with the organizational requirements. This involved
following the established guidelines and procedures set by my client, and the best practices given for Githubs VCS. 
It included:

###
1. **Version Control:** I utilized Github VCS effectively to manage code changes and collaboration. Although I technically did not collaborate,
I imagined myself in a scenario in which I was. Making sure my updates and commit messages were easily readable in a way that another collaborator
of the project could read them. Although as stated previously I did have an error, in which I ended up fixing by adding a second account I made as a collaborator, so I got to experiment and figure out how to do that.
I guess I could say I got a small preview window in how all that stuff works.
2. **Coding Standards:**
I adhered with the coding standards given by my organization and used github to help with this. Making sure I used multiple branches such as a main, and testing. Standardized commit practices, commiting changes was a frequent activity so I made sure these commits were accompanied with a detailed
and explanatory messages, simplifying change and making the tracking of project history easy and comprehensive. Pull requests were also utilized for peer review, ensuring each code change met the set quality criteria.
3. **Testing:**
I conducted testing and quality assurance processes to meet Globex's quality standards. This involved identifying and fixing bugs. Ensuring the software functioned correctly, and meeting user requirements.

Should MusoPlan have been a fork of another repository, integrating changes back into the central repository would involve:

1. **Regular Updates from the Original Repository**: Keeping the fork in sync with the original.
2. **Feature Implementation on Separate Branches**: Developing new features or fixes independently.
3. **Initiating Pull Requests**: For the integration of changes back into the main repository.
4. **Engaging in Code Reviews**: Collaborating with the maintainers of the original repository.
5. **Responsive to Feedback**: Adapting based on reviews and discussions.
6. **Awaiting Merge Approval**: Merge execution subject to maintainer approval.
